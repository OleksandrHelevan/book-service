1. For running this Rest API you should:
    - Open project;
    - Find class annotated @SpringBootApplication.
    - Run it as Java Application (Run).
2. Through the terminal (CLI)
   - Collect project:
   ./mvnw clean package or mvn clean package
3. Open Swagger UI in your browser:
   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html and test all Rest API methods.

I hope for an answer.
